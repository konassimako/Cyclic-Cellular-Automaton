# Cyclic-Cellular-Automaton
Implementation of a Cyclic Cellular Automaton with Python 2.7

A cyclic cellular automaton is a kind of cellular automaton rule developed by David Griffeath and studied by several other cellular 
automaton researchers. In this system, each cell remains unchanged until some neighboring cell has a modular value exactly one unit larger 
than that of the cell itself, at which point it copies its neighbor's value. One-dimensional cyclic cellular automata can be interpreted 
as systems of interacting particles, while cyclic cellular automata in higher dimensions exhibit complex spiraling behavior.

This is a two-dimension implementation of the cyclic cellular automaton that uses colours to indicate a cell's value.
